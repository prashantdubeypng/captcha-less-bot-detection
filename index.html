Thousands of signups appeared within minutes, but not a single real user could be verified. CAPTCHA had failed again. </p> <p> For years, CAPTCHAs were the frontline defense of the web. Click traffic lights. Select buses. Prove you are human. But the web evolved — and so did bots. </p> <p> Modern bots scroll. They wait. They click buttons with perfect timing. Some even solve puzzles faster than humans ever could. </p> <p> Yet something was still missing. Bots moved perfectly. Humans didn’t. Humans hesitated. Humans corrected mistakes. Humans paused mid-scroll. </p> <div class="spacer"></div> <h3>Behavior Over Puzzles</h3> <p> Instead of asking users to solve puzzles, engineers began asking a different question: what if we simply observed behavior — ethically and anonymously? </p> <p> Mouse paths curved slightly. Scrolls stopped mid-paragraph. Keystrokes arrived in bursts, not streams. </p> <p> Bots, on the other hand, behaved with precision. No pauses. No uncertainty. They finished instantly — every time. </p> <p> Perfection, it turned out, was the easiest thing to detect. </p> <div class="spacer"></div> <h3>A Quieter Kind of Security</h3> <p> Removing CAPTCHA reduced user complaints to zero. Security didn’t get louder — it got smarter. </p> <p> This page is part of a small experiment exploring that idea. Not to track you. Not to identify you. But to understand interaction patterns that distinguish humans from automation. </p> <p> Read naturally. Scroll naturally. Interact naturally. There are no right or wrong answers here. </p> <!-- ========================= TYPING TASK ========================== --> <h2>Typing Task</h2> <p> In 2–3 lines, describe a technology, project, or idea you find interesting. (Only typing <b>timing</b> is recorded — not the text.) </p> <textarea id="typingBox" placeholder="Type here..."></textarea> <!-- ========================= DECISION TASK ========================== --> <h2>Quick Decision</h2> <p>Which area interests you the most?</p> <button onclick="decisionClicked()">Backend Engineering</button> <button onclick="decisionClicked()">Machine Learning</button> <button onclick="decisionClicked()">Security</button> <!-- ========================= NETWORK TEST ========================== --> <h2>Network Interaction</h2> <p>Click to load sample data (used only to measure request timing).</p> <button onclick="networkTest()">Load Sample Data</button> <!-- ========================= END SESSION ========================== --> <div class="end"> <button onclick="endSession()">End Session & Submit Anonymous Data</button> </div> </div>
